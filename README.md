# NewYorkCity-Group-Project-with-SQL

In this project, we, as a team, tried to understand the data and columns what they refer. Also, we examined the data types of the columns and primary keys.
Took all questions and directions in detail. Moreover, we solved questions with other possible solutions to brush up our skills such as coding and
analytical thinking. 

While answering questions we used:
- Subqueries 
- Basic and aggregation functions such as GROUP BY, TOP, MAX(),MIN(), ROUND() etc. 
- Date functions such as DATENAME(), DATEDIFF() etc.
- CASE clasue 
- Window functions such as RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), LEAD() etc.
- Common table expressions CTE
- EXISTS expression
- Joins like INNER, LEFT and SELF (which was really insturctive) 
- UNION operator

You also might find data dictionary in the repository.
